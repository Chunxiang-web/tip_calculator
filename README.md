# tip_calculator
Purpose
To practice mathematical operations, round function, f-String

Challenge I ran into
When use round function, to have 2 decimals, for example the end result is $25.0, but want to see $25.00, this is a format issue, searched online, figured out can use "{:.2f}".format to display 2 decimals.

The project idea was from "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022"
